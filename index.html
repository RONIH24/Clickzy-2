            <h1>Student Review: </h1>
            <h2>"As a student who has struggled to stay focused throughout class, the idea of Clickzy has really seemed like something which would work. In addition, it would help create simplicity as the remote design and features appear easy to use. The inclusion of the headphone jack and microphone seems like something which would really help me with a class such as mandrin where I wouldn't have to continiously switch programs while recording me speaking. Overall, this a great concept I would look forward to using." <br><br>- Kobe Chen, <i>Dublin High School</i></h2>

            <h1>Teacher Review: </h1>
            <h2>"Throughout my years of teaching, attempting to find a product which makes it easier to assist students has been something I look for. Through the use of Clickzy, I believe it could help diversify the methods I currently use and make things easier on both ends. Ultimately, the simplicity which this product seems to have, and the functionality which it provides is what I think are the best features. In addition, this product ensures that students cannot cheat on assignments they otherwise could." <br><br>- Rosa Rodriguez, <i>Dublin High School</i></h2>
